For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">For all Xavierians, food was never scarce during their college days. Not just because this iconic college is on the hip and happening Park Street of Kolkata,9 surrounded by equally historic food joints, some of which are running from the British era, but because the college has a very well-stocked canteen. For those who feel going to joints next door like Flurys, might burn a hole in their pockets, they can always pay a visit to the St Xavier’sCanteen, housed within the building itself and open almost throughout the day, from 8am in the morning."Our college canteen is perhaps the busiest place in the campus. It is the place where almost every student is expected to pay at least one or two visits a day, even I do and that not just to have a taste of some delicacies, but also to brush him or herself up with the latest information, real or based on some rumor. Thus there is a free and frank discussion of fashion of various boys and girls and teaching habits of different teachers.St Xavier’s canteen is always overcrowded. Even school students from the senior section which is adjacent to the college, come in hordes during their recess. One gets a lot of choices for food and drinks like puri-sabzi, chicken patties, sandwich, cakes, rolls, tea, coffee, ice tea and many more and waiwai being pretty much demand. This canteen has been running for ages and has been renovated a couple of times. The new addition is a giant screen, where students crowd during matches or tournaments. Students come and sit and study as well. Why only students, even professors are fond of visiting the canteen, if not for anything else but for a cup of tea maybe! Apart from the canteen, there’s another famous square of Xavier’s, that’s the GREEN BENCHES. This is just beneath the Jubilee Building (Department of Multimedia), a place with green painted benches and tables. A good place for the students to come, sit and chill. "From 9:50 in the morning to 4 in the evening, the canteen is what kept me alive for 3 years of my college. Iced tea and coffee and counter kakus were the best part of my college life.

                        But the worst thing is that the canteen I left behind is not the one you'll ever be able to witness.

                        Leaving the canteen behind was more difficult than leaving the college."</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Kolkata, May 29 (PTI) A mobile application for attendance monitoring of students was being introduced by the St Xavier's College from the next academic session.
                        The app will also facilitate sharing study contents.
                        The application will help in recording attendance of students by teachers through tabs provided by college and the authorities were aiming to fully introduce it in the next academic session, college Principal Dominic Savio told a press meet here.
                        He said the mobile apps will also help in sending notifications to students in a particular room or multiple rooms and the process was already underway to give tabs to the teachers.
                        "The mobile app will facilitate sharing class notes, contents, diagrams among the teachers/authorities with students," he said.
                        The Principal added this was aimed for increased interaction between teachers and students with the use of modern technology and not for monitoring the students' move.
                        Among the other measures, the Principal said, the college will have a couselling cell for parents apart from students.
                        "Apart from the couselling facilities presently available to the students, the new cell will reach out to their parents," he said asserting it will be different from a typical parent-teacher meet one usually sees in schools.
                        "We consider the parents as being major stakeholders in the progress and overall development of their children. There will be counsellors in each department," Savio said.
                        To a question if such a move was necessitated by any recent incident of abuse of school children in few educational institutions or any case of depression having been reported, Savio said, "No no, we felt the need to have such a cell so that parents can also communicate with the college regarding any problem involving the student.
                        "It is only meant for the holistic development of the student."
                        The Principal said, the college aimed at setting up hostel for boys and girls at its rural campus at Raghabpur in South 24 Parganas district to enable students from interior areas of Sunderbans and other far flung places in the district at lesser fee than the main Park Street campus.
                        The college, which is the second oldest of Jesuit Institutions in India founded in 1860 by Father Henri Depelchin S.J, will also be introducing Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in all the subjects from coming academic year.
                        As per CBCS a science student can now take up arts subject and vice versa in between semesters.
                        "Earlier it had been introduced in Commerce and Business Administration departments and now we are extending it to the Arts and Science departments," he said.
                        "Preparations began in July 2017 with regard to curriculum, syllabus/examination ways and everything is in place for expeditious implementation," he said.
                        The college also planned to start a new chapter of the Alumni Association in South Africa in next August, taking the number of Alumni Association chapters to 10, he said.
